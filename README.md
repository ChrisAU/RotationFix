# RotationFix

This is how to stop the presenting view controller from rotating while presenting a view controller even if it the presenting view controller has disabled rotation.

It is a bug that occurs in iOS8 and iOS9 but doesn't seem to occur on iOS10 (it just doesn't rotate on presentation).

This app also shows how to fix the apparent iOS10 (beta) rotation issue by rotating to the current device orientation.
